# Q3 Stochastic Game (Iterative Best Response) Summary\n\nWe approximate Markov Perfect Equilibrium via iterative best response (IBR).\nStructural shift is measured by JS divergence between action distributions (expansion-year offseason).\n\nIterations=1, Episodes=1, MCTS iters=8.\nOpponents=LAS,NYL,PHO\n\nOutputs:\n- project/experiments/output/q3_stochastic_game_actions.csv\n- project/experiments/output/q3_stochastic_game_shift.csv\n
