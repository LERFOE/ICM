WNBA Team Performance and Financial Data (Last 10 Seasons)

WNBA Team Advanced Stats (2014–2023 Seasons)

The table below compiles key performance metrics for every WNBA team over the past decade. It includes each team’s season record (Wins, Losses, Win%), Offensive Rating (ORtg, points scored per 100 possessions), Defensive Rating (DRtg, points allowed per 100 possessions), Net Rating (ORtg–DRtg), Pace (estimated possessions per game), and Simple Rating System (SRS, which combines point differential and strength of schedule). These advanced stats were sourced from the WNBA’s official statistics (compiled via a Kaggle dataset) ￼. You can use this data to train a win% prediction model as needed.

(Notes: 2020 season was played in a bubble with a shortened schedule and no fans. “League Average” row in 2019 is shown for reference. ORtg/DRtg are per 100 possessions. SRS is measured in point differential (points per game) adjusted for schedule, similar to NetRtg but on a per-game basis.)

WNBA Team Attendance Data (2014–2023)

Since detailed financials (revenues) are not publicly available, attendance is used as a proxy for team revenue and fan engagement. The following tables list each team’s total home attendance and average per home game for the past ten seasons. Higher attendance generally correlates with better team performance (win%) and market interest. We will later analyze the correlation between win% and attendance to quantify how much on-court success boosts ticket sales (and thus revenue).

The attendance figures are compiled from league records and media guides ￼. Each season’s data includes the number of home games (GP), total attendance, and average attendance per game for each team:

(We see a significant attendance surge in 2023–2024 for teams like the Aces, Liberty, and especially the Indiana Fever – the Fever’s 2024 season (not fully shown above) saw 17,000+ average attendance, leading the league ￼. This surge corresponds with star players and improved team outlook, which we analyze next.)

WNBA Team Valuations and Revenue (Sportico Data)

To establish the causal link from team success to financial outcomes, we look at franchise valuations and revenues from recent Sportico reports (2024 and 2025). Sportico’s annual WNBA Team Valuations list provides each team’s estimated market value and revenue, offering a basis to calibrate how much an extra playoff run or star player could be “worth” to a franchise. Below are key points from the last two years of valuations:
	•	2024 Valuations: The Las Vegas Aces were valued at $140 million (highest in 2024), while the Indiana Fever were around $90 million ￼. The league-wide average team value in 2024 was only about $96M ￼. This means top teams (like the Aces) were worth roughly $50M more than a bottom team (e.g. Fever) – a gap partly due to market size (Las Vegas vs. Indiana) and partly due to on-court success and star power ￼. For instance, the Aces had recently won a championship, whereas the Fever were rebuilding.
	•	2025 Valuations: In one year, team values skyrocketed (~180% increase on average) thanks to surging popularity and new investors ￼ ￼. A new expansion team, the Golden State Valkyries, debuted at $500 million valuation – the first women’s team to hit that mark ￼ ￼. The New York Liberty (2023 runners-up) are next at $420 million, and the Indiana Fever – despite a poor recent record – jumped to $335 million (a 273% YoY jump from $90M) ￼ ￼. The Fever’s dramatic rise is attributed largely to the off-court impact of star prospect Caitlin Clark and a massive increase in attendance and sponsorships (they led the league with $33.8M in revenue for 2024 ￼, and averaged 17,000 fans per game, outdrawing some NBA teams ￼). In other words, even anticipation of success (drafting a star) translated into immediate financial gains.
	•	Revenue Multiples: Sportico noted that WNBA franchise values were about 12× annual revenue on average, the highest multiple of any pro league ￼ ￼. Total league revenue was ~$243M in 2024 ￼ (about $20M per team on average), so a championship-caliber team like the Liberty or Aces making perhaps $25–30M in revenue might have been valued around 4–5 times higher than a laggard making $10–15M in revenue. For example, in 2024 the Fever had top-tier revenue ($33.8M) and are now valued $335M, whereas the Atlanta Dream, with more modest revenue, were valued lowest at $165M in 2025 ￼.

Summarizing the impact of success on finances: A deep playoff run or adding a marquee star can boost attendance (and thus ticket revenue) significantly – our data shows a positive correlation between Win% and attendance across seasons (we will quantify this correlation, e.g. using Pearson’s r). In turn, higher revenue and greater fan engagement increase franchise valuation. For instance, the difference between a top team’s valuation and a bottom team’s valuation was on the order of tens of millions of dollars even before the 2025 surge ￼. After the 2025 revaluation, that gap widened dramatically (e.g. $500M vs $165M). We will use these data points to calibrate the parameter γ in our model, ensuring our “performance → financials” equation reflects real-world magnitudes. Specifically, if winning one more playoff round or signing a star boosts attendance by X% and revenue by Y%, we can estimate how much Vt (team value) and CFt (cash flow) would increase in response, based on the empirical Sportico figures and the correlation analysis (e.g. the Fever’s $245M value jump with a ~30% projected revenue jump sets an upper bound on γ) ￼ ￼.

Sources: The performance metrics are from Basketball Reference/WNBA stats (via Kaggle) ￼, attendance from WNBA archives and Across the Timeline ￼, and franchise valuations from Sportico’s 2024 and 2025 reports ￼ ￼. These data sets can be saved as CSVs for further analysis in our code. We now have the ingredients to proceed with modeling how on-court success translates to financial success.
